# About

## Who am I?
Hi, I am Mariya Messerli, an independent investor, a life-long learner, a cheerful thinker and a lucky mother of two young kids. After quitting my corporate job at the end of 2022, Iâ€™ve decided to fully dedicate myself to investment profession and family. My investment philosophy is global concentrated equity with long-term focus compounding value over decades. Prior to turning my investing passion into a profession, I had a decade of experience working in various corporate finance roles for Swiss Re, the top tear global reinsurer. As a result, my natural interest and past experience is rooted in the (re-)insurance industry. Over time, I aim to expand my circle of competence beyond the sector and master my investing process to contribute to wealth and wellbeing of my family, friends, and people who wish to come along. Please note, I am not a professional asset advisor and/or asset manager.

## Why?
The purpose of this platform is to share some thoughts on value investing, exchange with everyone who is interested and add value to the broader investment community. At times investing feels like a lonely place for introverts like me who engage into fundamental research and analysis day in and day out. Nevertheless, I am confident that there is bright and stimulating community of passionate investors who are willing to engage, learn from each other and have fun along the way. 

## What?
Once in a while I plan to publish investment research on companies of my interest. Since investing is not my only focus (hello kiddos!) I will do my best to post as much content as possible. For now, it is an experiment platform to pursue my passion, build new relationships and inspire other people to do so!

So if you are interested in joining me, please get in touch by subscribing to the blog and engaging in the comment section.


Warm welcome!

Mariya
