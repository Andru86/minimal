# Investment thesis
Markel Group Inc. (MKL) is a financial holding, which runs US Property & Casualty (P&C) specialty insurance operations and performs investments in a concentrated portfolio of wholly or partially owned publicly traded and private companies. The more accurate definition of the company according to its current CEO Tom Gayner is a ‘family office, which happened to be a public company’.

MKL’s business model was largely inspired by Berkshire Hathaway, whereby a float from insurance operations serves as a ‘rocket fuel’ to invest elsewhere. There are three economic engines, which are placed to work for MKL: Insurance, Investments (mainly bonds and common stock) and Markel Ventures (a collection of fully and partially owned private and public industrial and service businesses). 

### Summary:
  - Multi-decade compounder with consistent underwriting and investment results.
  - Remarkable culture embracing the ‘win-win-win’ values.
  - Management of high skill and integrity.
  - Fair price.

All in all, MKL emerged as an economic engine with autonomy-trust culture and diversified operations, which provide the dual benefit of generating underwriting profit and superior investment returns. Similar to some other conglomerates, the MKL’s value exceeds the sum of its parts.

## Multi-decade compounder
Markel started in 1930, after two generations of family ownership, the company went public in 1986 priced at ca. $8 with market cap of ca. $30m. Over time, the company has transformed itself from a small local insurer of jitney buses to the top three largest US surplus insurance business with some international operations (see [Market Segment Report - U.S. Surplus Lines, A.M. Best](https://www3.ambest.com/ambv/sales/bwpurchase.aspx?record_code=330137&AltSrc=22).

By year-end 2023, market cap reached close to $19bn, that is an impressive compound annual return of ca. 14% since the IPO. As outlined in the below, MKL managed to outperform the market by 3%-pts since inception.

In the past 5 years value creation slowed down facing challenging years of the Covid-19 pandemic, above average Nat Cat activity, financial market volatility and inadequate pricing cycle in some US Casualty lines exacerbated by rising social and economic inflation.

### Underwriting

MKL operates in the US specialty market, which implies underwriting of an admitted risk and hard-to-place non-standard risk (E&S, or Excess & Surplus). The latter one is not assumed by a traditional or so called admitted market. The regulatory framework affords E&S businesses greater flexibility in setting premium rates and terms for its policies compared to the admitted market. As a result, E&S insurers like MKL compete based on value-added considerations such as expertise, availability and service rather than price only. In the past years E&S market has been growing at a high pace with CAGR of ca. 20% to ca. $86bn, which many consider as the ‘golden age’ for E&S insurers. The overall E&S industry is expected to further grow with a double-digit rate, at much higher pace of the total P&C market. The key drivers are technological advancements, economic growth and rising complexity of the current and new emerging risks.

In 2022, MKL was the 3rd largest US specialty insurer and the 41st largest US reinsurer (as measured by premium volume by S&P Global and A.M. Best). In 2022, MKL’s combined net premiums earned amounted to $7.6bn, growing at an annualised growth rate of 13% in the past 10 years.

More than half of it is attributable to the Casualty business (mainly Professional Liability and General Liability lines), which tends to exhibit higher uncertainty towards pricing and loss reserve adequacy since claims are paid out over long period of time, i.e. multiple years. Also, this long-tail business is sensitive to macroeconomic factors like interest rates and economic inflation as well as social trends (i.e. social inflation). Despite of higher complexity, long-tail business comes with a benefit of longer periods of investment, which is supportive to the MKL’s business model.

How strong is the company’s underwriting quality? Since 2013, MKL earned underwriting profit of ca. $2.6bn with an average combined ratio of ca. 95%, which is ca. 5%-pts below the US P&C industry.

In other words, MKL made 5 cents per dollar of insurance premiums after paying all operating expenses, which is on top of money it held and could invest with market-beating returns.

Since 2005, there were only three calendar years (2017, 2011 and 2005) with a combined ratio of above 100%, all driven by the above average Nat Cat events. Indeed, this is a remarkable result.

How prudent are reserving practices at MKL? The main methodologies to determine loss reserves estimate (e.g. Chain Ladder, Cape Cod, Bornhuetter-Ferguson, Benktander, etc.) are designed to avoid volatility by ‘bleeding in’ news, good or bad, over time and not at once. As a result of this, loss reserves development tends to have memory. The MKL’s prior year loss reserves development was favourable in each consecutive year over the past 10 years, with total of $4.8bn of reserve releases (ca. 10% of annual earned premiums).

To put it simply, MKL over-reserved in prior years underpinned by high prudency of loss reserving and management discipline. To note, MKL’s favourable loss reserve releases reduced in the past years, in particular applicable for accident years 2016-2019. This is mainly driven by the US Casualty industry-wide challenges from the rising social and economic inflation. The final outcome of which is yet to be seen.

Since 2015, MKL has made numerous acquisitions to establish in-house ILS services and fronting operations with aim to reduce its cost of capital. This is an asset-light business model with limited risk-bearing and marginal fee-based returns. This sub-segment of MKL insurance operations is not performing up to expectations yet given the increased Nat Cat claims load in prior years. For the purpose of the below valuation, I’ve decided to assign no value to the ILS/fronting operations given its current track record, which may be too conservative considering its growth potential in the future.


#### Investments

Let’s turn to the investment side of MKL business. Similar to traditional insurers, a sizeable portion of MKL’s invested assets is allocated to fixed income securities and cash primarily to match duration of MKL’s future claim obligations with duration of assets. Bonds and cash amounts roughly to two-thirds of the MKL’s total invested assets (ca. $20bn of $27bn at year-end 2022). Assets in excess of that are allocated to a concentrated portfolio of public equities and a collection of fully and partially owned private equities. However unlike for many P&C insurers, MKL has relatively high allocation of invested assets to common stock (ca. $5.7bn, or 30% of total invested assets at year-end 2022). The public equity portfolio is relatively concentrated and the top 20 positions represent close to 50% of equity portfolio as per the latest 13-F filings (incl. Berkshire Hathaway, Alphabet, Deere & Co, Amazon, Visa, Apple, Home Depot, Watsco and others). Embracing value investment philosophy, the CEO Tom Gayner steers equity investments according to the four-part test:

1. Invest in businesses with good returns on capital that don’t use too much debt.
2. Management teams should possess equal measures of talent and integrity.
3. Invest in businesses that can reinvest earnings at good rates of return or redistribute it.
4. Fair price.

Remarkably, since IPO in 1986 MKL’s equity portfolio outperformed the S&P 500 total return index. See the annual investment return breakdown by asset category in the table below.

#### Markel Ventures
Since 2005, MKL started allocating capital to a collection of a majority owned private (mostly) and public industrial and service companies operating in various industries. Products and services include house plants (Costa Farms), building products (Lansing Building Products), crane rental service (Buckner Heavy Lift Cranes), pre-cast concrete (Metromont), concierge medical services (Partner MD), fire protection (VSC Fire & Security), IT consulting (CapTech), luxury bags (Brahmin), dredges (Ellicott Dredges), flooring (Havco), and more. Similar to Berkshire Hathaway, MKL prefers to invest in owner-founder lead operators with leading positions in niche markets and long-term orientation. It aims to offer a ‘permanent home’ to private businesses, which choose to join MKL.
